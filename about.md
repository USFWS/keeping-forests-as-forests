# About

Keeping Forests as Forest (KFAF) was created as a broad regional initiative with a focus on maintaining the long-term economic and ecological viability of southern forests. KFAF is supported by a diverse coalition of both private and public stakeholders ranging from human health professionals to traditional forest product manufactures and conservationists. This uniquely diverse partnership has coalesced around a common appreciation for the ecological, economic and social importance of our southern forests â€“ and the need to develop new and innovative approaches to its long-term stewardship.

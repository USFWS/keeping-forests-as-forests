# Our vision and goal

The KFAF partnership envisions a world where southern forests are valued as critical infrastructure that support the health, prosperity, security, and well-being of the American people. To achieve this vision, the goal of KFAF is to shift the paradigm of forest conservation in the South from one focused on piecemeal protection to one focused on the stewardship of the inherent social, economic and ecological values of functional forest ecosystems for the benefit of current and future generations, and in doing so, finding new and innovative ways to protect and sustain the approximately 245 million acres of remaining southern forests.

## How we get there

The ability of KFAF to reach its goals will depend on the successful implementation of three overarching
strategies:

* We must reposition our forests as critical infrastructure worthy of public and private investment while finding ways of valuing the myriad of critical services our forests provide.
* We must adopt a common regional identity to shape collective action in the South, creating a unified platform to influence policy which will lead to greater support for the conservation of southern forests.
* Adopt a voluntary policy across the Region of “no net loss” of forestland. While understanding that some forestland will be converted to other land uses, the goal is to adopt a no net loss approach to stabilize existing forest cover and target reforestation to the most appropriate and critical areas.

## Keeping forests as forests teams

Six workgroups have been formed within the KFAF collaboration to collectively move the Partnership&#39;s
strategic approaches forward.

* Planning - the identification of critically important forested watersheds within the Region.
* Policy/Political Action – creation of the strategic policy and political actions needed to achieve KFAF goals.
* Markets - the development of new markets for traditional and non-traditional forest products.
* Partnerships - the development of the public/private partnerships needed to sustain the initiative.
* Communication &amp; Outreach - the development of the communication and outreach materials needed to advance KFAF’s goals.
* Forest Values - the identification of traditional and non-traditional forests values important to both people and nature.
